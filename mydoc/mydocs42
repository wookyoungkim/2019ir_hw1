Cats knead with their front paws, but nobody's sure why they do it.
In adulthood, a cat supposedly will knead when it's feeling happy or content 
because it associates the motion with the comforts of nursing and its mother. 
Adding further weight to the explanation: Some cats even suckle on the surface they're kneading.
