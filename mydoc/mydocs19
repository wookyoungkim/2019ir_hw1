Are British Shorthair cats hypoallergenic? Unfortunately, no. 
Their fur is short but very thick and 
as any British Shorthair owner can attest, tends to get absolutely everywhere, even when brushed weekly. 
They produce allergens in the same quantities like any other cat and will trigger the same reactions.
