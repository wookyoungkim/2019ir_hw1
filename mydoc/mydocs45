Cats meow for many reasons, from the serious to the attention-seeking.
 Numerous diseases can cause a cat to feel hunger, thirst, or pain, all of
  which can lead to excessive meowing. 
  Cats of all ages also can develop an overactive thyroid or kidney disease, 
  both of which can result in excessive vocalizations.
