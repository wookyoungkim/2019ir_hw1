A domestic short-haired cat is a cat of mixed ancestry thus not belonging to any particular recognized cat breed—possessing a coat of short fur. 
Domestic short-haired cats should not be confused with the British Shorthair, American Shorthair, or other standardized breeds with "Shorthair" names, which are breeds recognized by various registries. 
Domestic short-haireds are the most common cat in the United States, accounting for around 90–95% of their number. 
The term tabby cat technically refers to a coat pattern, but is also often used as a general term for cats of this sort.
